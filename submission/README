Our entry works like this - we have a set of algorithms which assign weights to edges. The algorithms themselves are weighted so that as the game progresses we can emphasize certain algorithms over others. At each turn, we select the best edge (with the highest weight) as our move.

We have several algorithms:

- MST. We use the MST as our primary algorithm
- Path extension. This algorithm prefers to extend paths through the graph
- Enemy detection. This algorithm prefers to block long enemy paths in strategic spots (namely, sites that have few outgoing edges)
